          So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to
          McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of
          Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup
          various fonts for a type specimen book. It's difficult to find
          examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a
          dummy text in the 1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming
          across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type samples. So
          far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the
          popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory that the
          filler text has been used for centuries.

          Aldus Corporation, which later merged with Adobe Systems, ushered
          lorem ipsum into the information age with its desktop publishing
          software Aldus PageMaker. The program came bundled with lorem ipsum
          dummy text for laying out page content, and other word processors like
          Microsoft Word followed suit. More recently the growth of web design
          has helped proliferate lorem ipsum across the internet as a
          placeholder for future textâ€”and in some cases the final content (this
          is why we proofread, kids).
